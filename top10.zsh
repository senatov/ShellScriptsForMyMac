# top10.zsh â€” show top-N processes by CPU or memory on macOS
# Usage:
#   top10               # top 10 by CPU
#   top10 cpu [N]       # top N by CPU
#   top10 mem [N]       # top N by memory
#   top10 both [N]      # show both lists
#   top10 live [N]      # refresh every 2 seconds (no external 'watch' needed)
#
# Notes:
# - Comments are in English only (per your preference).
# - Sorting is numeric and locale-independent.
# - We add 1 to N because 'ps' includes a header line.
